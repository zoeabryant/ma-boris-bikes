A learning exercise practicing TDD and RSPEC. We were required to code a hypothetical version of the boris bikes software.

For this exercise we wrote out a Domain Model and CRC model to help structure our programmes.

Reek finds a total of 2 smells, prima donna methods. 'break!' and 'fix!'. We used a bang (!) to highlight that these methods make a change within a Bike class.
